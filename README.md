This repository contains code written for the Vynyl Senior Front End Software Developer position.

The provided prompt:
```
Write some code to flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of strings into a flat array of strings (e.g., [['one','two',['three']],'four'] -> ['one','two','three','four'].
```

I chose to write this example in Typescript, and included a basic Jest test.
